# Predictive-Modelling-Project


Imagine that you are a data analytics consultant for a firm who wants to get projected sale price of houses from house sale advertisements currently in the market, ignoring their asking price. The housing data (housing.csv)collected by the firm includes 500 sales in the last six months and include the variables. The last column is the outcome variable.

* elevation: Elevation of the base of the house

* dist_am1: Distance to Amenity 1

* dist_am2: Distance to Amenity 2

* dist_am3: Distance to Amenity 3

* bath: Number of bathrooms

* sqft: Square footage of the house

* parking: Parking type

* precip: Amount of precipitation

* price: Final House Sale Price

The aim is to develop the best possible linear regression model to predict the house sale price using the independent variables using a wide variety of techniques.
